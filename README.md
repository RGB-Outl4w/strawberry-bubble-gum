# Global Configuration and Index Repository

This repository serves as a centralized hub for globally essential files used across various projects and applications. It includes configuration files, index data, and other critical resources necessary for consistent operation and data management. 

## Contents

- The following will be added in the future. Stay tuned!
    * **`/config`**: This directory houses configuration files for different applications and services. These files define settings, parameters, and environment variables crucial for proper functionality.  Subdirectories may exist to organize configurations by project or type.
    * **`/indexes`**: Contains pre-built indexes used for search, data analysis, or other operations requiring optimized data access. These indexes might be in formats like JSON, XML, or binary, depending on their intended use.
    * **`/templates`**: This directory holds reusable templates for documents, scripts, or code snippets. These templates help enforce standardization and reduce redundant work across projects.
